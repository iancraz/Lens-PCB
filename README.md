## Overview
>[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The purpose of this PCB design is to simplify the process of controlling three stepper motors in your projects. By integrating an A4988 driver and an ESP32-WROOM32E module on a single board, you can easily interface with the motors and leverage the features of the ESP32 for advanced control and communication capabilities. In this design in particular three 2(A) stepper motors where needed to be controlled for a lens maker lathe, and the PCB was designed to fit the casing of the lathe.

# Features
>[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

* **Compact**: The PCB is designed to be as small as possible while still providing the necessary features for stepper motor control.
* **Integrated A4988 Driver**: The A4988 driver is integrated into the PCB, eliminating the need for a separate driver module.
* **Integrated ESP32-WROOM32E Module**: The ESP32-WROOM32E module is integrated into the PCB, eliminating the need for a separate microcontroller module.
* **Integrated WiFi and Bluetooth Antennas**: The ESP32-WROOM32E module includes integrated WiFi and Bluetooth antennas, eliminating the need for external antennas.
* **Integrated Power Supply**: The PCB includes a 5V power supply that can be used to power the ESP32-WROOM32E module and the A4988 driver.
* **Integrated USB to UART Converter**: The PCB includes a USB to UART converter that can be used to program the ESP32-WROOM32E module and communicate with it via serial.
* **Integrated Reset Button**: The PCB includes a reset button that can be used to reset the ESP32-WROOM32E module.

# PCB Design
>[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

This PCB was design using Altium Designer 23.4.1. The PCB design files can be found in [here](./Lens-Maker). The PCB was designed to be as small as possible while still providing the necessary features for stepper motor control. The PCB is a 6-layer board with the following stackup:

## Microcontroller
>[Design](#design)

The design of this PCB starts at the desition of the MCU chosen for this purpose. Because of its simplicity and WiFi and Bluetooth antennas already integrated, an ESP32-WROOM-32E is chosen for this design. The main advantages of choosing this microcontroller are:

* **The form factor**: Its a MCU with WLAN capabilities in a size of a regular MCU.
* **Antennas integrated**: The benefits of using an ESP32 module and not an ESP32 MCU is to have the antennas already routed an integrated.
* **Easy to use**: Its many integration generated that ESP32 is a widely used MCU around the world, and this means there's a lot of information and resources to program this MCU.
* **Versatility**: If there is a future design, a new ESP32 module can be changed and the software will 'just work'.

## Stepper Driver
>[Design](#design)

For the Stepper driver, since this design is a prototype approach for the final goal, an A4988 driver was chosen, because of its previous use on a concept desing using the A4988 module from arduino. For future progress a driver change is needed to drive more heavy power Stepper motors. However this driver has a lot of advantages, its ease of use and simplicity makes it really easy tu use and code it, and its application in its own module has the heritage needed for the circuit to rely on.
